\title{calculate the metrics of the EQR based on measures}
\usage{
calculate_metric_measures(fishdata, metric_name, metric_type,
  speciesfilter, exclude_species_length, only_individual_measures,
  NULL_to_0, sampledata)
}
\arguments{
\item{fishdata}{dataframe with fishdata}

\item{metric_name}{name of the variable to be calculated}

\item{metric_type}{reflects which information must be calculated: number_of_species, number_of_individuals, total_weight,... (info from calculate_metric_measures.csv)}

\item{speciesfilter}{formula indicating how to select the required species from data_taxonmetrics.csv (info from calculate_metric_measures.csv)}

\item{exclude_species_length}{formula indicating which individuals have to be EXCLUDED based on fish characteristics such as length (info from calculate_metric_measures.csv)}

\item{only_individual_measures}{value 1 indicates that only individually measured data should be used (info from calculate_metric_measures.csv)}

\item{NULL_to_0}{value 1 indicates that result NULL should be replaced by 0}

\item{sampledata}{table with earlier calculated variables to which the newly calculated variable should be added}
}
\value{
table sampledata in which the newly calculated metric is added
}
\description{
Calculates the metrics that are based on measures only, given a dataset with the information from calculate_metric_measures.csv and fish data.
