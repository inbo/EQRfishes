  \item \strong{metric} gives a list of 2 dataframes: one with the IBI and EQR, and one with the results for each metric,
  \item \strong{detail} gives a list of 3 dataframes: one with the IBI and EQR, a second with the results for each metric and a third with all calculated values
}}

\value{
Dataframe with calculated EQR for each sample, or list of dataframes if parameter output is specified
