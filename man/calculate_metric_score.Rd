\title{calculate the metric scores of the EQR}
\usage{
calculate_metric_score(metric_score_name, indices, metric_name,
  metric_value, width_river, slope)
}
\arguments{
\item{metric_score_name}{name of metric score to be calculated (NA if no calculation has to be done)}

\item{indices}{dataframe with indices and their tresholds (info from calculate_metric_score.csv)}

\item{metric_name}{name of the calculated metric}

\item{metric_value}{calculated value of the metric mentioned as metric_name}

\item{width_river}{width of the river at the sampling location (could be needed for calculation)}

\item{slope}{slope of the river at the sampling location (could be needed for calculation)}
}
\value{
A calculated metric score for the given values
}
\description{
Calculates the metric score, given a calculated metric value (and some parameters specific to the sampling location), and a table with the indices and their tresholds (info from calculate_metric_score.csv).
}
