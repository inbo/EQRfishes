\title{determine the zonation for records of a dataset}
\usage{
determine_zonation(dataset, version = c("new", "old"))
}
\arguments{
\item{dataset}{dataset on location measures with at least columns
\itemize{
    \item \strong{width_river} width of the river at the sample location,
    \item \strong{slope} slope of the river at the sample location,
    \item \strong{tidal} tidal effect present (TRUE) or absent (FALSE)?
    \item \strong{IndexTypeCode} type based on salinity of the sample location
  }}

\item{version}{'new' version with bron and brabeel or 'old' version without
these two zonations?
Defaults to 'new'.
This information will be used if dataset has no column `version` or to
replace NA values in column `version`.}
}
\value{
input dataset with additional column 'zonation'
}
\description{
This function determines the zonation based on the given dataset with
measurements.
Recently 2 new zonations were added: 'bron' (replacing 'upstream' in rivers
up to a width of 2 m) and 'brabeel' (replacing 'brasem' and 'barbeel' in
rivers up to a width of 30 m), and both versions are available here:
  \itemize{
    \item \strong{new} (default) uses the new version with 'bron' and 'brabeel' included,
    \item \strong{old} uses the version before 'bron' and 'brabeel' were added
  }
This version can be indicated on the level of the individual records in the
dataset as an additional column or on the level of the whole dataset by using
argument `version`.
When both are added, NA values of column version in the dataset will be
replaced by the version given in argument `version`.
