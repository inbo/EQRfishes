\item{exclude_species_length}{formula indicating which individuals have to be EXCLUDED based on fish characteristics such as length (info from calculate_metric_measures.csv)}

\item{only_individual_measures}{value 1 indicates that only individually measured data should be used (info from calculate_metric_measures.csv)}
}
\value{
A calculated value for the metric based on the given dataset and information
}
\description{
